* This module is useful for creating a timeline by date.  It is 
designed for travel trip planning but its use is not limited.
* The timeline is described by a simple set of specially formatted 
statements.  These statements indicate one of the followings:
** Set a date and/or time as the current time, and optionally print a remark
** Descripts an event lasting for a number of hours.  The event 
description is printed and the current time is advanced
** Advances the current time to a specified time in the next day
* These allow one to specify a starting time for a trip, calculate 
the arrival time using the specified duration, and note the next 
event as hotel check-in.  The 'next day' notation continues the 
timeline from the next day.  This allows the stay at a particular 
city to be extended or reduced and automatically adjust all subsequent 
events accordingly.
