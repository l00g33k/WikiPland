* Since Android 10 clipboard is accessible only when the Termux app is in the foreground, 
thus the !WikiPland clipboard access will first bring Termux to the foreground.

** On Pixel 10 Chrome seem to share .mhtml file but Opera still share the page URL.
* !WikiPland works well under Termux (https://termux.com/) on Android devices. The following instructions increase the utility by connecting !WikiPland to Android clipboard.
* It is assumed that you are running !WikiPland using Perl under Termux. Otherwise these steps are not necessary.
* Now that you have Termux, there are two steps to follow. More instructions are available from: https://termux.com/add-on-api.html
** Install 'Termux:API' from Google Play
** Install the termux-api apt package:
    apt install termux-api
* Verifing installation
** Send something to the clipboard
    termux-clipboard-set 'Hello world from Termux/WikiPland'
** You can check the Android clipboard for it
** Let's retrieve it inside Termux
    termux-clipboard-get
