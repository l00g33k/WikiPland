=Directory Notes=

This module generates or updates directory notes. If the named file does not 
exist, create a new one in memory.  You must clock 'save to file' to save.
The file initially has a table with 5 columns:
* filename
* Status: new
* timestamp
* size
* notes

If the named file already exist, scans the directory to update the table 
by inserting three new columns of status, timestamp, and file size to the 
right of the filename and shift existing column to the right

=Interface=
* The 'Refresh' button and the 'Run dirnotes' link do the same thing:
rescan directory.
* 'table edit dirnotes': launches table.htm to modify the table, e.g. 
make column same size.
