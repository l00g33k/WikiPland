The svg module has three interfaces. Only one interface is 
exposed through the 'path' interface that makes it visible 
in the launcher. This is the plotting interface. This document 
describes the plotting interface.

When a comma delimited file is sent to the svg module through 
the svg interface, an attempt is made to plot the graph using 
default settings. The following describes the form:

* 'Plot': click the 'Plot' button to plot the graph. The 
data is read from the file given to the right of the 'Plot' 
button.

* 'Extrator regex': the text field to the right is taken 
as a regex to extractor plotting data. In nothing is provided, 
a default expression is used. The default expression assume 
there are two numbers separated by ',', ':', or ' '. The first 
number is taken as X and the second number is taken as Y. An X/Y 
graph is plotted.

Any custom regex may be entered. The data are to be extracted 
by (). When two pairs of () are specified, an X/Y graph is plotted 
where X = $1 and Y = $2. When only one pair of () is specified, 
a line graph is plotted where X = count and Y = $1.
