* This is a trival spreadsheet implementation.  The spreadsheet formula is described in a table.

* The first row names the column.  A name must be valid Perl variable name starting with an alphabet 
follow by alphabet and number.

* The second row are the initial value for the column consists of either numeric literal or 
valid Perl expression.  The values for the colunmns to the left may be referenced by the 
colunm name with '$' prefix.

* All subsequent rows are Perl expressions.  Values for the column may be referenced by 
column name prefix with '$'.  Values from the previous row may be referenced by the column 
name with '$' prefix and '_' suffix.  For the following example $YEAR may be referenced 
by all columns on the right.  Values from the previous row may be referenced as $YEAR_

* A special notation of the form ':x#' repeats the following rown # times.

* "$NAME = VALUE ;" before the table defines constants.

* The following is a simple example.  [[/view.htm?path=$|View]] this page for raw text;
 [[/calc.htm?path=$|calc]] this page:

$RATE = 0.05;

|| YEAR%d     ||      P ||        INT ||       SUM ||
|| 2023       ||   1000 || $P * $RATE || $P + $INT ||
|| :x10       ||        ||            ||           ||
|| $YEAR_ + 1 ||  $SUM_ || $P * $RATE || $P + $INT ||
