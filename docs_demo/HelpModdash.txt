=Special Keywords=
* %DASHHIDE:ON% and %DASHHIDE:OFF% will cause the dash module to ignore content 
between these two keywords.
* [ [ # name ] ] : makes an anchor to be listed in 
'Jump marks' list at the bottom of the page.  The 'Jump 
to end' link at the top allows quick navigation to this 
list which in turn allows you to quickly jump to your 
targets.  (Spaces added in [ [ # name ] ] to defeat making an anchor; remove 
spaces in document.)
* Similar to anchor described above, adding ??? at the end 
of a second level heading makes a link in the 'Jump marks' 
list, e.g. ==my task==???(newline) makes a link to this heading.

=Custom category color=
* %DASHCOLOR:black:Gold% for black on gold; use web color

=Other notations=
* ===chapter=== (3rd level) to hide low priority tasks
* !!! at the end of comment to make a sticky note at the bottom (& in BOOKMARKS)
* !! at start to hide in the latest
* ! at start to hide but add to !# count
* +# hides for # days from timestamp
* Make comment date in the future to hide it
* \\n are converted to newlines
* Just timestamp is ok to mark new date, e.g. * 20171005 001200
* * 20171005 001200 time.start and * 20171005 001200 time.stop to record time spent
* ^text, to mark a do now item, in yellow on fuchsia
