=Special Keywords=
* %DASHHIDE:ON% and %DASHHIDE:OFF% will cause the dash module to ignore content 
between these two keywords.
* [ [ # name ] ] : makes an anchor to be listed in 
'Jump marks' list at the bottom of the page.  The 'Jump 
to end' link at the top allows quick navigation to this 
list which in turn allows you to quickly jump to your 
targets.  (Spaces added in [ [ # name ] ] to defeat making an anchor; remove 
spaces in document.)
* Similar to anchor described above, adding ??? or @@@ at the end 
of a second level heading makes a link in the 'Jump marks' 
list, e.g. ==my task==???(newline) makes a link to this heading.
* %DESCFIND:regex% triggers the generation of the 'Desc find:' links at 
tbe bottom for a shortcut to search for 'regex' in the description 
field.  An additional link would produce search with details listed
** This can also be triggered by the descriptions of the special 
cat1='----' and cat2='DESCFIND'.
* %DASHBANNER:banner_text% will wikitize the 'banner_text' and display as a banner near the top of the page.  This allows quick jumps to be put near the top of the page.  Example to jump to anchor 'abc', [[#abc]] :

    %DASHBANNER:*d*[[#abc|Jump to KIVtmp]]**%

=Custom category color=
* %DASHCOLOR:black:Gold% for black on gold; use web color
