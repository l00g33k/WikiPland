=Find=
* This is a recursive search module. The following fields 
are available:
==Filename==
* File match regular expression. The filename must 
match the regular expression for it to be listed or 
searched.  Multiple regular expression may be supplied 
and separated by |||
==Content==
* This field may be blank. When it is blank, file 
content is not searched. Only the files matching the Filename 
field are listed.
* When this field is not blank, the files are listed when the 
regular express match any single line in the content of the file. 
The search logic may be inverted by prepending !! so that only 
files having no match will be listed.
==Path==
* This field may be blank. When it is blank, and when 'Recursive' 
is checked, all sub-directories will be searched.
* When this field is not blank, only directories path name matched 
the regular expression will be searched.  When !! is prepended, 
the search logic is inverted, i.e. those directories matching 
the expression are excluded from search.
==Max. lines==
* Limit how many lines in the files to search. Useful 
when you have many million lines files so you can limit your 
search to the first specified number of lines.
==Recursive==
* Recur into sub-directories when checked.
==Sort offset==
* When this field is blank, the outputs are sorted by path names.
* When a number is specified, the specified number of characters 
from the start are ignored, and the results are then sorted by 
the remainders. For example, you can specify a number to skip 
the date so that the results are sorted the hour of the day. 
Of you can sort by part of the path names.
==Submit==
* Click the button to sort
==Clr==
* Clear most fields to default. Very useful 
when running on cell phone.
==CB2name==
* Paste the clipboard content to the Filename field. Very useful 
when running on cell phone.
==Wrapped text==
* When check, outputs without formating and allow wrap around.
==2cont==
* Paste the clipboard content to the Content field. Very useful 
when running on cell phone.
==Filename only==
* When listing files only, i.e. blank Content field, list 
only filenames without size and date/time.
==Send file to==
* Specify which module to send to when the result link is clicked.
