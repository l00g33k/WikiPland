=DOPL=
The DOPL directive allows the specification of a Perl do file using absolute or relative path:

    %DOPL</sdcard/x/ex.pl>%
    %DOPL<./ex.pl>%

The return value of the script must be a string.  The string is included into the source file at the 
point of the directive.

This example demonstrats the generation of a string and the return of string:

    $output = sprintf("* %s 0x%x %d\n* wiki\n\n", 'This text is generated by del.pl', 0x6502,0x6502);
    $output;

This example results in this text in the output:

    This text is generated by del.pl 0x6502 25858
