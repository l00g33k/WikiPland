=Help for l00http_tree.pl=
* This module lists all files within a sub directory tree

=Diff'ing Two Directory Trees On Two Devices=
* At time there is desire to sync two directory trees on 
between the desktop and the device, and you don't want to 
rely on the cloud, or cannot use the cloud, or is too slow. 
For examle, trying to sync the 5 GBytes DCIM directory on 
the device to the 9 GBytes master copy on the desktop. Or 
may be you simply want to know the difference and what 
are new. Oh, and you have renamed and organized into sub 
directories on the desktop. !WikiPland can help.
* Theory of operations:
** For each directory tree, using Linux utilities to 
generate a list of all files and their md5sum in the sub 
directories.
** Copy these files to the desktop
** Using !WikiPland's md5sizediff module to compare md5sums
* Follow these steps to compare the content of two 
directories tree. 
** Browse to the target directory using the tree module:
http://localhost:30337/tree.htm?path=/sdcard/DCIM/Camera/
*** In the normal directory listing view of the ls module, 
click the &lg;dir^gt; link for the '..' listing is another 
way to launch the tree module
* At the bottom of the page copy the command lines and paste 
into an appropraite console to create the signatures. 
For example:
    # md5sum computation can be accelerated by using bash commands as follow:
    cd /sdcard/DCIM/Camera/
    du -h
    OUTDIR=./
    DESC=_
    pwd > ${OUTDIR}m5_20160910_161745${DESC}.m5sz
    time find -name "*" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 stat -c "%s %n" >> ${OUTDIR}m5_20160910_161745${DESC}.m5sz
    time find -name "*" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum >> ${OUTDIR}m5_20160910_161745${DESC}.m5sz
    # and send m5_20160910_161745${DESC}.m5sz to tree.htm for processing
    #speed is approximately 12-26 secs/GB
** The variable OUTDIR=./ allows you to send the files else where. But local is usually fine
** The variable DESC=_ allows you to easily add comment to the filenames
* Move or copy the files to one location.
* Open these file in tree module and save imported results in 
'filemgt tree.htm' link
* Open these two exported files in the md5sizediff module and 
enter both files into and click 'Compare'
http://localhost:20337/md5sizediff.htm
** Notes that you need either !TerminalIDE or 
Termux on your device if it has been rooted because Linux 
utilities are used to speed things up.
