=Syncview Overview=
* Syncview displays two documents side by side and 
aligns lines using markers found using regex.  This 
is particularly useful when viewing say the timestamped 
console logs of concurrent processes.  The markers 
are found using regex.  The markers could use only 
part of the match by enclosing the marking patterns 
in parenthesis and thereby excluding parts of the regex 
not inside parenthesis.  The matched markers need not 
be unique.  In a sequence of regex matches, there could 
be intervening lines without match, and only the first 
hit in a consecutive series of the same matched pattern 
is recognized.  This allows for says using date as the 
matched pattern and therefore making each new day a 
new marker.  The matched patterns may repeat, as long 
as there are intervening and different patterns, such 
as using days of week as marker.
