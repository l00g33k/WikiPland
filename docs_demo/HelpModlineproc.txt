* The 'edit box' contains multiple lines of Perl statement. 
Each line of the input is loaded into $_ and each line of the 'edit box' 
is 'eval'. For example, the line "s/apple/orange/g;" will change all 
occurances of 'apple' to 'orange'.
* The output is saved in l00://lineproc_out.txt. You will have to save it 
if you want to keep the results. You could use the filemgt module by 
'view' it first and follow the 'launch' link.
* 'whole file' checkbox: When checked, $_ contains the whole file with \n separating the lines.
* $last, $_, $next are defined when the expressions are eval'ed. $last is the content 
of the line that has already been processed. $next is the content of the line to 
be processed next. $_ is the line being processed. $last and $next provide 
the one line context around line being processed. Before the first line 
is processed, $last contains the first line and $_ and $next are undef; after 
the last line has been processed, $_ and $next are undef and $last is the 
last line. To process only the current line, simply operate on $_; since 
the result is under, it will not be output.
* The variable '$lnno' is pre-defined to be the line number starting at 1.
