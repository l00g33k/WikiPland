=Introduction=
The 'shellsh' module allows you to specify commands to be sourced remotely 
through 'ssh' or other shell commands and prints the output on the browser.
Note that you need to make sure that the commands are not interactive, or else 
the session may hang, requiring you to abort the !WikiPland Perl script to recover.

=Explanation Of Form Fields=
==shcmd==
This is the command to be executed locally to access the remote shell.  It 
is assumed that the string following the command is sent to the remote shell 
to be executed.  You can also execute locally using 'bash'.  Exampels:

    ssh
    sshpass -p password ssh name@domain
    bash -c

=Local path=
If 'Commands' field is blank, then the content of this file is piped to the 
remote shell into the file 'Remote path' and then sourced.  Otherwise the 
content of 'Commands' is first written into 'Local path' and then piped to the 
remote shell into the file 'Remote path' and then sourced.

=Remote path=
The commands are written to this fully qualified path in the remote system 
before it is sourced.  '/tmp/mycommands.bash' or /dev/shm/mycommands.bash' are appropriate.

=Commands=
You can put any commands here, but be sure they do not require user response 
as no user input is possible.  Also be aware of the size of the output that 
does not overwhelm your systems.
