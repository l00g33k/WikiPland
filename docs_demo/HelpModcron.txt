The cron moduel is a crude emulation of the Linux cron job.

The syntax is inspired by the cron job too:

* * * * * cmd
m h d m w cmd

In this simplified implementation, the time fields can be * which 
matches anything, or a single number that match the respective field.
No range is allowed. For example, this matches every minute:

    * * * * * cmd

This matches on 1 minute past the hour:

    1 * * * * cmd

As the names imply, they are executed at the respective time:

    @boot cmd
    @shutdown cmd

Three kinds of commands are supported:

* A local URL 

    http://localhost:20347/toast.htm?helloname=cron+says+hello&submit=Submit&ip=127.0.0.1

* An external URL, using wget:

    http://google.com

* A shell command:

    date
